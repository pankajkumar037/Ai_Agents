      "Summary: Elon Reeve Musk (; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for his key roles in Tesla, Inc., SpaceX, and X, formerly Twitter (which he has owned since 2022). Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to President Donald Trump and head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk is the wealthiest person in the world; as of February 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$397 billion. \n",
      "Musk was born to an affluent South African family in Pretoria before immigrating to Canada, acquiring Canadian citizenship via his mother. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the software company Zip2, which was acquired by Compaq in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank, that later formed PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired U.S. citizenship, and eBay acquired PayPal. Using the money he made from the sale, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and became its chairman and later CEO. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for fraud, alleging he falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla; he stepped down as chairman and paid a fine. Musk was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, and rebranded the service as X the following year. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump's newly created DOGE.\n",
      "His political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, affirming antisemitic and transphobic comments, and promoting conspiracy theories. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service.  Musk has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of U.S. president Donald Trump since 2024. He was the largest donor in the 2024 presidential election, and is a supporter of far-right activists, causes, and political parties.\n",

      "Page: Views of Elon Musk\n",
      "Summary: Elon Musk is the owner of multiple companies, the wealthiest individual in the world, and a special government employee. Having rejected the conservative label, Musk has described himself as a political moderate; his views have become more right-wing over time, and have been characterized as libertarian and far-right. As the owner of Twitter, he has  suppressed critics, and after his involvement in European politics, his views have received criticism from some world leaders. Musk has also expressed his opinion on topics from science and technology to religion and philosophy.\n",
      "Within the context of American politics, Musk voted for Democratic candidates from 2008 until 2020, before switching to Republican candidates in 2022, and supporting Donald Trump in 2024 who he previously feuded with. He has identified as a  \"free speech absolutist\" and has expressed support for universal basic income, gun rights, a tax on carbon emissions, and H-1B visas. Musk has been a critic of wealth tax, short-selling, government subsidies and Wikipedia, and expressed concern about the perceived dangers of artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change. He has criticized public transportation and transit systems, rejected labor unions, and is a pronatalist. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Musk defied lockdowns, describing them as \"fascist\", supported the Canada convoy protest against vaccine mandates, and made contentious epidemiological claims.\n",
